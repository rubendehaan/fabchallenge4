Our fourth and last Fab Academy microchallenge revolved around the creation of food-specific tools.<br>


### Abstract
Traditions of crafts have been formed around local resources, materials, and land. These ancient techniques have transformed our cultures and ways of life for centuries. Within these past few generations, the world has become hyper-globalized, industrialized, and digitized. Not only does this take a heavy impact on the world, we also lose our material connection and the stories of materials and crafted objects. Drawing inspiration from ancient knowledges from three different localities around the globe, we reflect on how past traditions can be used to imagine and speculate on the rituals of our future. 

How can traditional knowledge be used to intelligently reflect on future scenarios?
How can indigenous craft be used as a tool for re-imagining and reflecting on our current crises? 


### Goals and aims
Build a speculative tool around a future food-related scenario, which will strike up conversation and engagment on topics of ...

### Re-contextualising local crafts
'Stipwerk' is a local decoration technique applied by a diminishing group of craftswomen around the area of Staphorst, Rouveen and Nieuwleusen in north-west Overijssel. The practize is closely related to their unique local traditional clothing and agricultural work. In the past years an initiative started to host a website with the aim to revive the tradition by proposing new ways of using the technique.

### Contaminated Earty 
Korea has a long tradition in the craft of pottery, founded from the wealth of the soil and clay in the Earth. In the past half century, Korea has been dealing with a problem of nuclear waste disposal. Along with many other places in the world, there is no fullproof and sustainable way to The craft of pottery  at the issue of nuclear waste pollution in East Asia, and pairing

### Specifying local problematique
Since around 2015 a national 'space-crisis' arose in The Netherlands as result of urbanization, industrialization, expansion of city borders and the support of farmers with the motto 'bigger is better'. In the past years this led to a series of literal clashes between farmers-politicians, farmers-industry and farmers-real-estate about land-use, policies on fertilizers, greenification among others. On top of this the handful of - more or less - unaltered natural parks are protected strictly by EU Natura 2000 guidelines suppressing the surrounding farmers more. <br>
Land became scarce and therefore all the more valuable. It's time for experimental alternative ideas and solutions on honest land use.
